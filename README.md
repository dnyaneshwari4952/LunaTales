### API Integration

#### Stable Horde API (Illustrations)
The app includes placeholder integration for Stable Horde API:

```javascript
// Example API call
const response = await fetch('https://stablehorde.net/api/v2/generate/async', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'apikey': 'your-api-key-here'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    prompt: "A soft, kid-friendly cartoon illustration...",
    params: {
      width: 512,
      height: 512,
      steps: 20,
      cfg_scale: 7
    }
  })
})
```

To enable illustrations:
1. Get a free API key from [Stable Horde](https://stablehorde.net/)
2. Replace `'your-api-key-here'` in `src/components/StoryGenerator.js`
3. Enable illustrations in the app settings

### Customization

#### Adding New Themes
Edit `src/components/StoryGenerator.js` to add new story themes:

```javascript
const themes = {
  'your-theme': {
    setting: 'your setting',
    characters: ['character1', 'character2'],
    elements: ['element1', 'element2'],
    beginnings: ['Beginning 1', 'Beginning 2'],
    endings: ['Ending 1', 'Ending 2']
  }
}
```
